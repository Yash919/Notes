Managing Files / Directories

(Ex -> sed ’s/oldtext/newtext/g‘  To change every old text wherever it is present means if it present in substring there also change)
(Ex -> sed ’s/oldtext/newtext/ig‘  To change every old text with no case sensitive)

User Management  


(Creating a user in linux)

Useradd <option> <username> 

UserMod -G grouptoadd username  To create password for user

Passwd username (than enter)



File Permission 


Rwx - rw - r  - -        ->   ( file type , owner permission, primary group permission, others permissions )   

(We can change permission) 

Symbolic method 
Ex -> chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file_name      (+ to add permission, - to remove permission 
 
Absolute method
Read - 4 Write -2  Execute - 1 (Ex -> chmod 764 filename) 


System Management


History -> list all commands executed by a user

Free -> free memory of a server

/proc/meminfo -> Displays memory information  ( cat /proc/meminfo )

/proc/cpuinfo -> Display Cpu information ( cat /proc/cpuinfo )

Uname -a -> show kernel information 

Du -> show directory space usage

Whereis -> show possible locations of app (Ex: Whereis ls)

Which -> show which app will be run by default


Software Management  


(**Note Yum commands need to run under root user)

Yum install <package name>

Yum remove <package name>

Yum update <package name>

Yum info <package name>

Yum update <package name>

Yum list available -> ( check on the repository which local system is connected with)

Yum list installed  -> ( check on local system )


Networking


Hostname -> ( we can change name via editing /etc/hostname ).  (**Note “Hostname name” will change the name directly) 

Ping -> availability of destination server over the network.

Wget -> download packages/softwares onto linux system.

Ifconfig -> lists ip addresses of the server (Command not found)

Telnet -> connect to remote host / check port availability status (Ex -> telnet localhost 22{port number} ) (Telnet need to download )

Curl -> access the application as from browser 

Netstat -tulpn -> (which ports our application has used) ( Not installed ) 

*** init 6 -> (To restart the session) ( This will shutdown the connection ) 


Services


You can use systemctl command also like. (Systemctl stop https)

**(You can start/stop via root user or you need password )

For 80 the file should be present near {cd /var/www/html} if not present it will show default page 

Service <name of the service> status ->  To check status of service

Service <name of the service> start -> To start the service

Service <name of the service> stop -> To stop the service  Service <name of the service> reload -> To reload the service

Service <name of the service> restart -> To restart the service

Chkconfig —list   -> To check availability of service

Chkconfig <service> on -> To make the service available after restart 

Chkconfig <service> off -> To make service unavailable after restart  


Process Management 


Ps -ef. -> list all the services which are present

Kill process_id -> kill the process.   (Kill -9 process_id) “-9 -> sure kill” 

Sleep 500 -> To stop the process you can use (ctrl + z).     Sleep 500 &  -> “&” symbol can be used to run the process in background or you can do like { bg %1 } first run command job to see if there is any process which are stopped in background  and if there is than give the number which present like bg %2

To make this background process run in foreground than run the command ( fg %1) process number which can be seen via command jobs.

Top -> display top cpu utilised processes.


Archiving files and directories


**Note gzip zip not worked on directories.  Tar should be used.

Gzip -> create compressed file (Ex -> gzip filename) 

Zip -> (Ex zip file1.zip file1).  -> zip name_of_zip which_file_you_need_to_zip)

Gunzip -> unzip a file

Tar -> extract tar file (worked on directories) Ex -> tar -cvf dir1.tar  dir1    { c-> create v-> verbose f-> file } 


# To untar the directory
Tar -xvf dir1.tar   {x-> extract } 


***Note ( you can zip the tar files )

To extract .tar.gz (which are firstly tar than zip ) you can use command
Tar -xvzf filename  


Crontab can be used to run recurring tasks or commands to run automatically at specified intervals.

Crontab -e  -> To edit

Crontab -l -> To see all jobs which are going to run 

**To run a job every minute you can do  Ex: 
-> * * * * * echo “6” >> /tmp/file5 (symbol is star)  
 Link Files 

2 types -> soft link , hard link

Soft Link -> shortcut file (like we create shortcut on our desktop), space optimized, If original file deleted link is broken and data is lost., {for soft link you will see L in permissions.}

Command: ln -s sourcefile destinationfile

Hard Link -> backup file () size of both file is same, If original file deleted than also link will contain data

Command: ln sourcefile destinationfile

**Note To run the shell script “.sh”  you should give permission for execution. 

shell script  Video- 38


Copy File between servers


Windows to linux
	mobaxterm or winscp
Linux to Linux 	
  SCP secure-copy -> Ex ( scp source_file_name username@destination_host:destination_folder  	

Copy one server to another server -> scp file1 root@10.20.30.40:/tmp
Copy remote system to local system -> scp root@10.20.30.40:/tmp /home/ec2-user
	
	( To copy directories you need to add command -r {recursive} 

 
Ssh key based authentication


Ssh-keygen

Ssh-copy-id
