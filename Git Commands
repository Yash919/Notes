git rm <file> -> This command removes a file from the Git repository.

git checkout <branch-name> -> switch branch

git checkout -b <new-branch-name> -> create new branch.    git branch -> To see all branches in local 

git branch -D 

git reset —hard -> command moves the HEAD (current branch) to a specified commit and sets the working directory and staging area to match that commit.
